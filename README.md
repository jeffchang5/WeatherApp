I created GpsFragment in Java and have its functionality consumed by a CurrentWeather Kotlin
Fragment class. Although, being very comfortable with both Kotlin and Java. I decided to use
technologies that shows my competency using the greatest and latest the community has to offer.
Currently, I work with a codebase that has a lot of Java code written in. However, to fully utilize
Co-routines and Jetpack Compose, I had to adopt Kotlin for the majority of the project.

**Your Focus Areas.**

Software Architecture, Code Style, Readability, Robustness and using standard Android development
practices.
